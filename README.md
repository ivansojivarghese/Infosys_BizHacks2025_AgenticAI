# Infosys_BizHacks2025_AgenticAI

Problem Statement: How might we design a scalable and responsive measurement framework - powered by AI or agentic systems - that can track brand performance and connect it to business metrics such as lead quality, sales velocity, and cleint engagement?


# Setup Instructions: 

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-brand-measurement.git
```

Install dependencies
(We recommend using a virtual environment)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```


üîë Getting a Groq API Key
Go to https://console.groq.com/keys.

Sign in and create a new Custom API Key.

Copy the generated key.

üõ†Ô∏è Replacing the API Key
Open the api_key.py file and replace the placeholder with your new key:
s
```python
GROQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

Make sure not to commit your key to version control if this file is tracked. Add it to .gitignore or use environment variables for better security.
